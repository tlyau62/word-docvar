<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please may I have your comments on his proposal for &nbsp;14 March HP submission.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Please return the plans with your comments by&nbsp; 31st Dec 2022.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;Other than those comments intended for internal use only and which should be sent under separate cover, please copy your comments to the authorized person KUO X ON for early follow up action where appropriate. &nbsp;A self-adhesive label is attached for this purpose.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be appreciated if you could invite the AP to make amendments in your office in the event that non-conformities identified can be readily rectified. &nbsp;This should facilitate the approval process and eliminate the need for recirculation of plans for comments.</p>
